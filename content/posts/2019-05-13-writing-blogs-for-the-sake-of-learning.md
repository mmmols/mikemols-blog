This is my very first blog post. Bare with me. My intentions are all good. My writing skills will suck at first, but hopefully grow exponentially throughout this journey. 

The reason why I created this is quite selfish. It is not for you - it is for me. Entirely, just for my own sake. I love writing essays and have been writing those almost every day in an app called Bear. But the problem with Bear is that it is private. So no, you cannot read it. And the main purpose of its use is to jot down words quick and tag them so the words are quickly attained by a simple search of the tag. 

So no it is time. Time for me to read all of thoughts from Bear and combine those into essays, which will give me some sort of knowledge base of my own. 

Most of the writings will sure not be neutral. You can read boring technical documentation if you have that desire. Here, I will write whatever feel appropiate.
